The admissions counselors did not make me feel welcomed and did not help me arrange plans to visit the campus. Also, I unfortunately needed more financial aid.
The major deciding factor for me not attending Texas A&M was the lack of scholarship opportunities. I was offered the Aggie Eagle Scout scholarship however for medical reasons the corps was not a good option for me so I actually could not use the scholarship. I am disappointed because Texas A&M has always been my first choice school but I just could not justify the cost without any scholarships.
More scholarships or a way to finance my studies 
I would've attended, but the cost of attendance was too high.
Offered more options for students with extenuating circumstances 
Honestly, I really did not want to go to Texas A&M, so nothing would have secured my attendence. I applied so my parents would be happy since they went there.
Earlier awareness of application process
Well, a better financial aid package would have been nice and a better "recruitment" program.
nothing!! it just came down to being accepted to my first choice school 
I received a conditional acceptance to attend Blinn for two years and then transfer to the main campus.  I was recruited for a position on the Equestrian team at the University of Georgia, which I accepted.  So, in answer to the question, if I had been accepted to the main campus, I would have been happy.
I was supposed to attend a campus visit but it was cancelled due to weather conditions. It was supposed to be rescheduled but never was, or at least I was not informed if it was. If I went to that campus visit that day, I probably would've chosen A&M.
Offer more financial aid than The University of Texas at Austin. 
Nothing, really. The Texas A&M environment just wasn't for me.
